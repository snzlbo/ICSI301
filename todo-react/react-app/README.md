## First in first you need to use following scripts

In the server directory, you need to run 
### `node index.js`
in order to start server.

### If you see "Server is running on localhost:4000" thats your half work has done. 

Next up you have to run 
### `npm start`
in react-app directory.

#### And its all done! Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
#### Also you can see whats going on backend which is connected to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
You may see results in result directory which is containing "localhost:3000 and 4000"s screenshots.
